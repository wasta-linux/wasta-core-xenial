wasta-core-xenial (0.9.2) xenial; urgency=medium

  * schemas.override: changing default theme to just "Ambiance": things like
    gedit that don't work right with Ambiance under Cinnamon work fine under
    Unity: need to research "why?" but will keep theme as Ambiance under Unity
    for now.  Other desktops need to override the setting, such as is done
    in wasta-cinnamon-xenial to set "Ambiance-Orange" as the default theme,
    which works better with gnome apps like gedit.
